                <p>
					Hello everyone. Welcome to part 2 of my blog on Blockchain with JavaScript. Previously in my last blog, I explained and showed the
                    simple coding of basic blockchain with minimal understanding of how it works. We know and acknowledge JavaScript as one of the
                    widely used programming languages for software developers and programmers. So now, I will demonstrate the blockchain with more
                    secure concepts.
				</p>

                <p>
                    I'll be demonstrating how I created a secured transaction that will prevent people from attempting to tamper with the link of blocks
                    and it was done in a few techniques that I have learned over the past few months: Proof of Work, mining transactions, and signing
                    transactions. Let's start with the first technique.
                </p>

				<h2>Proof of Work</h2>
				<p>
                    Why do we need Proof of Work implementation? It is an algorithm that secures an unsecured network of blocks by generating a hash
                    that links the hash for the current block. This process would be validating the transaction to confirm, close, and open new blocks.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Proof-of-work.png" />
                        <figcaption>getHash and mineBlock methods</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

				<p>
					Here we have a method called mineBlock with a property, diff (or difficulty), and inside the brackets, I made the hash of the block
                    begin with a specific number of zeros. So, I must create a while loop that continues to run until the hash has a specific number of
                    zeros. Inside the bracket, I add the substring of the nextHash with a character zero and continue to have it until it matched the
                    level of difficulty. It will keep running on the loop until the hash is not equal to zeros.
				</p>

                <p>
                    Add the console log to print the hash of the new block that just mined. I then must add a nonce value which is a random number to
                    iterate the getHash calculation's output.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>Blockchain class</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Next, I go to the addBlock method and the line that comments out simply creates a new block with a different hash and replaces it
                    with newBlock.mineBlock to pass with the level of difficulty.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Proof-of-work3.png" />
                        <figcaption>Test Proof of Work</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h3>
                    Output
                </h3>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/Proof-of-work4.png" />
                        <figcaption>Output of the Proof of Work</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now, it is time to test the Proof of Work implementation by using the console.log statements as shown above. So, we would know the
                    hashes on the specific mining block. As you can see after running blockchain.js by using node, the hashes of the new blocks started
                    with two zeros based on the level of difficulty from the constructor. This a good note for everyone who is curious about changing
                    the level of difficulty, the higher the difficulty, the longer it takes to mine new blocks and the number of zeros would change
                    depending on the number of zeros. This technique would allow us to control how fast the new blocks can be created and added to the
                    blockchain.
                </p>

                <h2>Mining Transactions</h2>
				<p>
					Our next technique is called mining transactions by creating bitcoins into the system. The purpose of this technique is to validate
                    the digital transaction on the system when we use or add to the ledger.
				</p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/MiningData.png" />
                        <figcaption>Data and Block classes</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
					I create a Data class for the digital transaction. So, the transaction of the data receives a fromAddr, a toAddr, and a quantity
                    (or amount of coins). I would then create and assign each of them inside the constructor as shown above.
				</p>

                <p>
					Next, I modify the Block class to support the transactions. I simply delete or comment out the index argument because the block
                    orders are set out by the positions in the array, not by the index. I also must omit the first parameter from createBlock method to
                    match the number of properties as the constructor.
				</p>

                <p>
					Next, we must create something to store pending transactions and a method to mine the new blocks for pending transactions. Why do we
                    have to do this? As of now, we create blocks on a specific interval. The Proof of Work that I mentioned earlier makes sure that
                    there's one block created at a specific time. All the transactions that are made in between blocks are stored in the pending
                    transaction array temporarily and are to be included in the new block. So, I started modifying the properties inside the constructor
                    of the Blockchain class by adding pendingData for the pending transactions which equals an empty array. Then, I create another
                    property miningDeposit which we would see to deposit how many coins into the system. So, when see below I assign miningDeposit with a
                    thousand coins.
				</p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/MiningData2.png" />
                        <figcaption>Blockchain class</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
					Before we get into the mining method, we must delete the addBlock method as I have mentioned in my previous blog. I just replace it
                    by creating miningCompData for pending transactions which will receive an address, miningCompAddr. Inside this block, I type let
                    block equals new Block that includes a timestamp, Date.now(), and a pending transaction, pendingData. Next, let's start mining it by
                    typing block.mineBlock with a difficulty that is set within the system. I added the console log as you can see below to print the
                    message and prove that a block is successfully mined. I then added to the chain by pushing the block into an existing blockchain.
				</p>

                <p>
					Next, I must reset the pendingData array and create a new transaction afterward. So, define the array with new Data or transactions
                    which included null because fromAddr did exist yet, send toAddr, and deposit the amount into the system. Now, I created an addData
                    for the new transaction to receive it and it will push into the pendingData or pending transaction array.
				</p>

                <p>
					The getAmtofAddr method would show you to check the amount of the address. The purpose of this method is to store the transaction
                    information in the blockchain. I type the let balance equals 0 as the deposit. I then create a for loop inside a for loop with if
                    statements for credit and debit transactions in the account. Finally, once the for loop is stopped looping, we return the balance.
				</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/MiningData3.png" />
                        <figcaption>miningCompData, addData, getAmtofAddr methods</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now, it's time to test the mining transactions. First, I create a couple of transactions with a random string of addresses, addr1
                    and addr2, and 80 would send to addr2 from addr1. Remember addr1 and addr2 are the public keys of the users' wallets. After the
                    transactions are created, they will be in the pending transaction array. So, the miner has to create a block for storing transaction
                    information on the blockchain. So, I typed blockChainJS.miningCompData with the receiver's address, userAddress.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/MiningData4.png" />
                        <figcaption>Test Mining Transactions</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Then, I typed the "node blockchain.js" to run it and it creates an output as shown below. As you can see, the block was mined
                    successfully with its respective hash of two leading zeros. Ok, the reason why the first attempt has a balance of zero is that the
                    user's balance did not exist before the new block was created.
                </p>

                        <figcaption>Output of the Mining Transactions</figcaption>
                    </figure>

				<h2>Signing Transactions</h2>
				<p>
					Our last technique of this blog is signing transactions. This is one is important because the techniques I demonstrate in this blog
                    do not have restrictions on transactions. So, I will show you how to make it mandatory for transactions to be signed with both
                    private and public keys so that you can only change the balance if you have a private key.
				</p>

				<p>
					First, I must clean up the blockchain.js and transfer all the code except the test code to the new .js file, blockchain2.js. The
                    reason I did this is that I want blockchain.js as a driver and to make it simpler. Second, I create a new file, keygen.js, with the
                    first line of code to call out elliptic library. This library will generate public and private keys and methods to sign and to
                    verify a signature. Since this is not a default library in the Visual Studio Code application, I must type the command,
                    “npm install elliptic”. The next line of code is an instance of elliptic with an elliptic curve,
                    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/secp256k1">secp256k1</a> which is algorithm for the bitcoin to implement key cryptography. I
                    then generate a key pair for both public and private keys with the hex format.
				</p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/SigningData.png" />
                        <figcaption>keygen.js</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    After I run the keygen.js, you can see both public and private keys in the command prompt as it shown below.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Output
                </h3>

                        <img src="./assets/images/SigningData2.png" />
                        <figcaption>Output of the Key Generator</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Now, let's start creating the code for signing transactions. I added code for Data class by creating a method that can check if the
                    signature on the transaction is valid. I added getHash to create a hash by returning the SHA256 hash of the transaction which it
                    would be used to sign with the private key. Next, I create a signData method for signing a transaction by receiving a key to sign
                    it. To sign the transaction, we must show the public and private key pair. signTheKey is the object from the elliptic library. So, I
                    created the const hashData with assigned getHash() and the const sign or signature to take the signTheKey to sign the hash of the
                    transaction in base 64. Then store it into this.signature in the hex format.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The last method for the Data class is to validate it. Inside the if statement, it will return true if the fromAddr is empty and we
                    would assume the transaction is valid. Next, I create a new public key object from the fromAddr which is public and to be use the
                    elliptic curve library to pass the fromAddr to convert into hex. Return the public key by verifying the hash of the block that has
                    been signed by this.signature. Remember, I included elliptic curve in this JavaScript file, I must import elliptic library into the
                    file.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/SigningData3.png" />
                        <figcaption>Data class</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The next code I will show is to verify all the transactions in the current block. I created hasValidData method inside the Block
                    class by creating an if statement and if the transactions could not find anything then it would return true.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/SigningData4.png" />
                        <figcaption>Block class</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We are done coding the signing transactions. Now, it's time to test it. First, I import the elliptic library and then to initialize
                    the user's key, mykey, assign it with the same private key that we generate earlier, and then retrieve the public key from the
                    user's myPersonalKey in hex format. Second, we're making a transaction with const transfer1 equals new Data with myPersonalKey, a
                    string of other user's public key, and number of coins to transfer. Third, sign the transaction with myPersonalKey, and added to the
                    blockchain, make the pending transaction or miningCompData to be sent to myPersonalKey where no one can access to it, and output the
                    balance of the myPersonalKey.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/SigningData5.png" />
                        <figcaption>Test Sigining Transactions</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Next, create console.log to see if the chain is valid. As you can after running it on the first attempt, it is valid. But when I try
                    to tamper the chain on the second attempt as you can see below, it is no valid. The reason it happened because the signature does
                    not match.
                </p>

					The techniques you read on this blog are the examples of the progression I've learned from basic blockchain to the blockchain that
                    is tampered proof. This technology is evolving and I'm very keen to learn more about it and I hope you've learned a lot as much as I
                    did. Thank you for visiting my blog and take care for now.
