					If you ever heard of Bitcoin or you are curious about cryptocurrency, you probably heard about blockchain technology as well. The
                    idea about it is more than just virtual money exchanges. Blockchain is a modern and recently developed network that has the power to
                    contribute to any online ventures. How's that works? In this blog post, I can explain how the blockchain works in JavaScript.

				<h2>What is a blockchain?</h2>
				<p>
                    Before I can show you some coding, we need to understand what a blockchain is. The term blockchain comes from two connected words.
                    Each block consists of some basic records or information by cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp of when the
                    creation of the block, and transactions' records that has happened in the block.
                </p>

				<p>
					The chain is the computer network that process these blocks. The records are sent through the number of computers that are connected
                    on a same network and it computes through a part of a distributed ledger that copies the activities between blocks. Also, we don't
                    want to have any flaws in the chain and its records must not be changed, mutable, nor hackable; therefore, once the information is
                    sent to the blocks and put on record, the information is permanent or absolute.
				</p>

                <h2>How to build a blockchain in JavaScript?</h2>
				<p>
					As you all know, the programming language we use makes all the difference in creating new programs. Systems have required us to learn
                    the specific programming or coding languages for different system that we are building on. For example, C++ is the programming
                    language of Bitcoin. So, if you want to build a Bitcoin, then you are required to learn and understand the C++ language.
				</p>

                <p>
					But that is a completely different topic. In this blog, I will tell you how the blockchain works in JavaScript. JavaScript is one of
                    the most widely used programming languages that many software developers and programmers already familiar with. As of now, blockchain
                    become very noticeable, well known, and next emerging trend in the mainstream world of technology and it is worthy to look deeply
                    into the blockchain in JavaScript in depth. So, this is why the ability to use the JavaScript as a coding language for blockchain is
                    essential because it allows us to start coding so easily since we are very familiar with it from beginners to experts. If you are
                    creative and methodical that can create or improve the blockchain, then JavaScript will be an easy starting point.

            <section id="setup">
				<h2>Setup</h2>
				<p>
					We all know there are many source code editors for JavaScript to choose from, I am using Visual Studio Code for creating the
                    blockchain because I got so use to this IDE for quite some time now. Throughout this blog post, I will be using oop, or
                    object-oriented programming, style. So, I expect you will have knowledge about JavaScript without any forms of difficulties. Before
                    you're about to create a new JavaScript file, make sure you created a new file in the preferred directory of where you want it to be
                    stored. This is done by moving the cursor to the explorer, right click the specific directory, left click "New File", and type
                    whatever name you want with the JavaScript extension. Or another way is a cd command followed by the path of the desired directory in
                    the Visual Studio Code's terminal and then create a new file.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are also another two ways to create a new file in the Visual Studio Code's terminal, you can use the "code" keyword to create a
                    file, or you can use the "echo" keyword to create a new file. First method, after opening the Visual Studio Code's terminal
                    (CTRL + `), go to the preferred folder and use the following command to create a new file with the JavaScript extension,
                    "code blockchain.js", where blockchain is the name of the file you want to make. Last step, type any text in the file and use
                    CTRL + S to save the file in the preferred folder that you choose. The other method to create a file in the Visual Studio Code is
                    echo keyword. It is very similar to the code keyword but this time type "echo > "blockchain.js"".
				</p>

                <p>
                    Awesome, now you are ready to start coding the blockchain. Let's proceed shall we.
                </p>

				<h2>Creating a block</h2>
                <p>
                    As I said earlier of this blog post, a block is an object that stores basic information on it as a block class shown below.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/block.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Block constructor</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Here we have "this" keyword as the current object in a constructor. The reason why use this keyword is to avoid the confusion between
                    class attributes and parameters with the same name. As of now, it's missing the immutability or incapble of changing the state of the
                    object. We can make the blockchain work by using a hashing fuction that hashes all the properties in the block. Hashing is absolutely
                    essential for the blockchain technology, because each block gives a unique identity, for example identification of the block, and the
                    ability to change or alter the block of the blockchain impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm going to use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js">sha256</a> hash function for this JavaScript file, because it is
                    considered the most secure hashing algorithm available. Since the JavaScript doesn't have this particular algorithm by default, I
                    have to import a crypto library, which it includes dozens of different kind of hash algorithms, through npm command in the Visual
                    Studio Code's terminal by using the command "npm install --save crypto-js". Before to continue coding, make sure to import sha256
                    function directly into the JavaScript file as a constant as shown below.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/sha256.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Constant of SHA256 hash function</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Once it's imported, now you can start using it.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/gethash.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>getHash method</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This getHash method shown above, what it does it returns sha256 hash of the index, previous hash, timestamp, and stringify the data
                    object to convert a JavaScript value to a JSON string. Next, we added the code that ensures the immutability of a block. The prevHash
                    ensures that the blocks will stay unchanged along the lifespan of the blockchain. It contains the hash of the previous block, so you
                    can assure the immutability of that previous block will make the next block's hash, or getHash, different.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/block_2.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>getHash method</figcaption>
                    </figure>

				<h2>Creating the Blockchain</h2>
				<p>
					Now, we have created a block. Next, we are going to linked or chained them together securely. I will talk you through how the
                    blockchain class works. I initialize the blockchain by adding the constructor. So, it creates a chain of property and its going to be
                    an array of blocks. The createBlock method is the first block of the blockchain and returns the new block with an index number,
                    timestamp of the block's creation, data of any string you want, and previous hash of the block. Since this is the very first block
                    and it cannot point to any previous blocks at this point; therefore, it can be any hash and I simply just type "0" to make it easier
                    for everyone to understand that zero is the very first number.
				</p>
                <div>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="./assets/images/blockchain.jpg" />
                        <figcaption>Blockchain</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>

				<p>
                    Ok, we initialize the very first block of the blockchain. Now, we're going to add new blocks to the existing blockchain. Add the
                    getLastBlock which it returns the latest block in the blockchain. So, it returns the last element, which is length minus one.
                    Finally, add the addBlock method that will receive a new block. What this method is trying to do is adding a new block to an existing
                    blockchain. It needs a bit more coding than we did at the start of the file, because it must be assign into the array. Assign the
                    latest block with the next hash to the previous hash property of the new block. Now, we move on to the next block and this will
                    create a new block with a different hash, newBlock.getHash(). The last line of the addBlock method is to push the new block into the
                    existing blockchain.
                </p>
				
				<p>
					All the simple coding above is just the basic blockchain. It is not considered a complete implementation of the blockchain, but
                    enough minimal information how it works. As I'm still researching more about better secured blockchain, you will learn more
                    implementations of the next blog that JavaScript can show you how to make it more secured.

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a widely used programming language and one of the important core technologies in IT. This language is easy to learn for
                    everyone regardless the level of experience in programming language, especially by experienced programmers or software developers
                    that can learn a new language quickly. Anyone who would like to create their own blockchain at ease, JavaScript would be a good
                    starting point to learn more about the blockchain.
